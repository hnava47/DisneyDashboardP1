## About The Project
The purpose of this project was to provide a dashboard which contains information about a user's favorite Disney character. The user has the option to enter the Disney character into the search input. When the user starts typing, they are also prompted with potential character names they can choose from.

![Auto][autocomplete-screenshot]

Once the user clicks search, the data is populated in the dashboard. The information includes shows, games, and films that the character has been apart of. The user has further options to select a film, which will then display the film trailer.

The user also has the option to save the character for reference later. Once the character is populated in the dashboard, the user can click the plus button to add the character to their favorites list. When they reenter the page, they can click on the character listed in favorites and the dashboard will be populated with their data (rather than searching for them again). If the user wants to remove the character from the list, they can select them in the list and click the minus button. The user can remove multiple characters at a time.
![Fav][fav-screenshot]
![Del][del-screenshot]

If the user enters an incorrect character name, the page will notify them accordingly.
